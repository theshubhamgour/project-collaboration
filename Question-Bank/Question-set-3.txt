4. **Write a code snippet to create a set with elements 1, 2, and 3.**
5. **How can you add an element to a list? Provide an example.**
6. **Write a Python code to access the value associated with the key `"name"` in the dictionary `{"name": "Alice", "age": 30}`.**
7. **What is the output of this code?**
   ```python
   lst = [10, 20, 30]
   print(lst[1])
   ```
8. **How do you change the value of an element in a list at a specific index? Provide an example.**
